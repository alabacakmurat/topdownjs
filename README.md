## TopdownJS - Documentation

Hi there! If you're looking for the documentation, you should check this page here:

### To-do

* Overlay feature

    I am going to add an overlay for TopdownJS, which will be enabled/disabled globally or call-specific. I'm also thinking on adding an option to dismiss the topdown when the user clicks on the overlay or presses the escape button.
